Though I'm really proud of this piece of code, I am I'm humbled by the fact that I would have no idea of how to code it on another language, 
or without one of the following libraries: streamlit, pandas, ipyvizzu, snowflake. A huge thanks to the teams behind them, the work they do 
is amazing and we unfairly take it for granted.

I guess it all boils down to the following conversation I had with my kid:
> Dad, so programers just do a bit of copy and paste code they google and then it works? 
>
> Of course not. You have to think a lot. Define the WHAT, the HOW, the WHY. And copy and paste A LOT of code.
